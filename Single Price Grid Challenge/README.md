## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
Changing the Grid to rows only in mobile view.
```

### Continued development

I would love to expand more on some text maniuplation techniques in CSS as I couldn't find this
quite straight as I imagined.
